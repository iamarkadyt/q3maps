When reverse engineering pk3 files:

* Unpack textures and scripts folders directly into the baseq3 folder.
* Then add unpacked shaders names to the baseq3/scripts/shaderlist.txt file.
* Finally, in the radiant, set the game folder to the directory containing the abovementioned baseq3 and the game binary.

Good luck!
